# To-Do List
## Building a todo list as a React application
<br>
<b>Description:</b> Our task in this activity was to create a to-do list as a dynamic application in React. The list is able to add tasks and delete tasks when clicked. I also changed the styling to update the color, font, and spacing of the components.<br>
<br>
<b>How to Run:</b> Clone this repository to local system and run on local server. Click "Add ToDo" too create a new list item and click list items to delete.<br>
<br>
<b>Future improvements:</b> Future iterations will add a margin to the top of the header in that same color as the backgroud.<br>
